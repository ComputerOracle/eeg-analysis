# EEG Analysis Project

This project contains my beginner exploration of EEG brain data analysis using Python and MNE.

## What I did
1. Plotted raw EEG brain signals to understand how brain waves look over time.
2. Computed basic brain wave power (delta, theta, alpha, beta bands).
3. Visualized how brain activity changes across time.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to understand EEG data step by step and learn how brain signals can be analyzed using code.

## Dataset
The original EEG dataset is large and is not included in this repository.  
To run the notebooks, place your EEG files inside the `data_samples/` folder.

## Tools Used
- Python
- MNE-Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This is a learning project focused on understanding the basics of brain signal analysis and building practical experience with real neuro data.
